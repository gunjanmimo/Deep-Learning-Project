FACIAL expression is one of the most powerful, natural and
universal signals for human beings to convey their emotional
states and intentions. Numerous studies have been conducted on automatic facial expression analysis because of its
practical importance in sociable robotics, medical treatment, driver
fatigue surveillance, and many other human-computer interaction
systems. In the field of computer vision and machine learning,
various facial expression recognition (FER) systems have been
explored to encode expression information from facial representations. As early as the twentieth century, Ekman and Friesen
defined six basic emotions based on cross-culture study, which
indicated that humans perceive certain basic emotions in the same
way regardless of culture. These prototypical facial expressions
are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Contempt
was subsequently added as one of the basic emotions. Recently,
advanced research on neuroscience and psychology argued that the
model of six basic emotions are culture-specific and not universal
.
